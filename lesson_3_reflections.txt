When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Backup. Sharing. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Donâ€™t want to bring in changes made by other before you are ready

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    First, the silly answer: forks are eating utensils, clones are identical
    copies of things and branches are offshoots of tree trunks or other
    branches.
    Seriously though: A fork is a github-specific type of clone that
    maintains a relationship between the clones. A clone is just an exact
    copy of a repository. A branch is a bit trickier. In some ways it is
    just a label applied to certain commits, but in a more logical way it 
    is a splitting of the tracking of changes to the code to allow multiple
    version to be developed at the same time within the same repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This allows you to work offline more while still having the latest
    remote code at the ready.
